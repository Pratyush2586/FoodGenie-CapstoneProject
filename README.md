Contemporary diners have difficulties in selecting meals, leading to avoidable food wastage and a restricted range for culinary experimentation. The lack of an efficient solution that combines visual recognition with personalized recipe suggestions is a major challenge for consumers who want to optimize their usage of resources. To resolve this problem, it is evident that there is a distinct need for a cutting-edge instrument that effortlessly incorporates these functions. This project proposes to use computer vision to identify ingredients and natural language processing (NLP) to provide personalized recipe recommendations. Its goal is to empower users to improve their cooking skills, reduce food waste, and expand their culinary knowledge. It will be capable of identifying items using visual cues and generating personalized recipe suggestions. These recommendations will consider individual tastes, dietary constraints, and available resources. This comprehensive strategy seeks to transform the process of selecting culinary choices, promoting a more sustainable and daring cooking experience for consumers.
